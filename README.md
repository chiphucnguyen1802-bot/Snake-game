🐍 Snake AI Demo

Overview

🐍 Snake AI Demo is a modern version of the classic Snake game built with Python and Pygame.
This project demonstrates how a simple AI agent ⚡ can automatically control the snake to eat apples 🍎 while avoiding walls and its own body.

Grid-based gameplay on a 20x20 board

Apples 🍎 spawn in a safe zone, avoiding corners and edges for smoother AI performance

The snake 🐍 grows longer after eating apples

Game ends if the snake 🐍 hits the wall 🧱 or itself

Features
1. AI-Controlled Snake ⚡

Greedy path selection: AI moves the snake 🐍 in the direction that reduces the distance to the apple 🍎

Collision avoidance: prevents hitting walls 🧱 or the snake’s body 🐍

Fallback logic: if the preferred path is blocked, AI selects an alternative safe direction

Demonstrates how simple AI ⚡ can outperform human players

2. Manual Play 🎮

Control the snake 🐍 using arrow keys

Press Space 🔄 to restart after game over

Real-time score ⭐ display on the screen

Installation 🛠️

Ensure Python 3.x is installed

Install Pygame:

pip install pygame


Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-url>
cd snake-ai-demo

How to Run ▶️
python snake_ai.py


The AI ⚡ will automatically control the snake 🐍

You can also play manually using the arrow keys 🎮

How the AI Works ⚡

The AI is rule-based, not machine learning 🤖

Each frame, the AI performs the following steps:

Calculate optimal direction toward the apple 🍎

Check safety: ensure the next move does not hit walls 🧱 or the snake 🐍

Fallback: choose an alternative safe direction if the preferred path is blocked

Results in more stable gameplay and higher average score ⭐

Notes 📝

Current AI ⚡ is basic but effective for demonstration purposes

Advanced options:

Use pathfinding algorithms (BFS/A*)

Apply reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to maximize survival and apples eaten 🍎

Designed as a demo to showcase AI logic in games
